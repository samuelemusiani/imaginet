# Description:
#  This is an example of a wirefilter cable.
#  The topoly is very simple as only two namespaces are connected to each other.
#  The end goal is to understand how different protocols react to different 
#  problems that occur in the network.
#
# What to learn:
#  In this lab you will learn different protocols behave when facing different 
#  problems on the network.
#  
#
# What to do:
#  As in the first lab you should chose a network that you want to use and
#  assign ip addresses to the two namespaces. Then test that you can communicate
#  between the two namespaces.
#
#  The you can attach to the wirefilter cable with the command:
#       
#     imaginet attach conn1
#
#  This should open a new terminal window with the wirefilter console. There
#  you can change varius parameters of the cable and see how it affects the
#  communication between the two namespaces.
#
#  For example iperf3 is a good tool to test the bandwidth between the two
#  namespaces. You can run it in one namespace with the command:
#
#     iperf3 -s
#
#  And in the other one with the command:
#
#     iperf3 -c <ip address of the first namespace> -t 1000
#
#  Then you can start experimenting with the wirefilter console. For example you
#  can change the loss rate of the cable to 5% and see how it affects the
#  bandwidth. You can change the duplication rate, the delay, the noise and other
#  things. Try experimenting with different values.
#  Also don't stick with iperf3, but try other protocols like ICMP (ping).

namespace:
  # This is the first namespace
  - name: ns1
    # A list of interfaces for the namespace. Ony one is specified here
    interfaces: 
      # The name of the interface
      - name: eth0

  - name: ns2
    interfaces:
      - name: eth0

# Cables are like real ethernet cables
cable:
    # Every cable has a name that must be unique
  - name: conn1
    endpoint_a:
      name: ns1
      # For namespaces the port is the name of the interface and must be
      # specified
      port: eth0
    endpoint_b:
      name: ns2
      port: eth0
    wirefilter: true
