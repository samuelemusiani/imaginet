# Description:
#  This is a simple example of a network with two namespaces.
#  You can think of if as just to generic Linux PCs connected to each other.
#  The end goal is to be able to ping between the two namespaces.
#
# What to learn:
#  In this lab you will learn how to configure and ip address on Linux interface.
#
# What to do:
#  First you should chose a network that you want to use between the two 
#  namespaces. For example 10.0.0.0/24 is a good choice.
#  Then you should pick two ip addresses from the network to assign to the two
#  namespaces. We can use 10.0.0.1 for the first namespace and 10.0.0.2 for the
#  second one.
# 
#  To assign an ip address to an interface you can use the following command:
# 
#     ip address add <ip address> dev <interface>
#
#  For the first interface the command would be:
#
#     ip address add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0
#
#  After adding the ip address to the second namespace you should be able to 
#  ping between the two namespaces.
#
#  So you should see something like this:
#
#   user@ns1 $ ping 10.0.0.2
#   PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
#   64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.748 ms
#   64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.515 ms
#   ^C
#   --- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
#   2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1020ms
#   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.515/0.631/0.748/0.116 ms

namespace:
  # This is the first namespace
  - name: ns1
    # A list of interfaces for the namespace. Ony one is specified here
    interfaces: 
      # The name of the interface
      - name: eth0

  - name: ns2
    interfaces:
      - name: eth0

# Cables are like real ethernet cables
cable:
    # Every cable has a name that must be unique
  - name: conn1
    endpoint_a:
      name: ns1
      # For namespaces the port is the name of the interface and must be
      # specified
      port: eth0
    endpoint_b:
      name: ns2
      port: eth0
