# Description:
#  This example shows a simple routing between two namespaces using another as 
#  a router. The end goal is to be able to ping between the two namespaces in
#  different networks.
#
# What to learn:
#  In this lab you will learn how to configure the most simple router
#
# What to do:
#  In this case the ip addresses are already configured in the namespaces.
#  You should only configure the default route for ns1 and ns2. This can be
#  done with the following command:
#
#     ip route add default via <ip address> dev <interface>
#
#  For the first namespace the command would be:
#
#     ip route add default via 10.0.0.254 dev eth0
# 
#  To be able to make routing works you probably need to enable ip forwarding
#  on the "router" namespace. This can be done with the following command:
#
#  /usr/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
#
#  Now you should be able to ping between the two namespaces.

namespace:
  - name: ns1
    interfaces: 
      - name: eth0
        # You can assign an ip address to the interface in the namespace
        ip: 10.0.0.1/24

  - name: ns2
    interfaces:
      - name: eth0
        ip: 192.168.1.1/24

  - name: router
    interfaces:
      - name: eth0
        ip: 10.0.0.254/24

      - name: eth1
        ip: 192.168.1.254/24

cable:
  - name: conn1
    endpoint_a:
      name: ns1
      port: eth0
    endpoint_b:
      name: router
      port: eth0

  - name: conn2
    endpoint_a:
      name: ns2
      port: eth0
    endpoint_b:
      name: router
      port: eth1
