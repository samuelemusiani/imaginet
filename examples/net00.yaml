# This is one of the simplest examples for ImagiNet
# Two namespaces and a switch are created. Two cables from the namespaces
# to the switch are created. The namespaces should be able to communicate

switch:
  # This is the simples switch where only the name is specified
  - name: sw1

namespace:
  # This is the first namespace
  - name: ns1
    # A list of interfaces for the namespace. Ony one is specified here
    interfaces: 
      # The name of the interface
      - name: eth0

  - name: ns2
    interfaces:
      - name: eth0

# Cables are like real ethernet cables
cable:
    # Every cable have a name that must be unique
  - name: conn1
    endpoint_a:
      name: ns1
      # For namespaces the port is the name of the interface and must be
      # specified
      port: eth0
    endpoint_b:
      name: sw1

  - name: conn2
    endpoint_a:
      name: ns2
      port: eth0
    endpoint_b:
      name: sw1
