# Description:
#  This example shows a more sophisticated example vlans. In this case we have
#  two switches and 2 namespaces connected to each of them. Namespaces are
#  called ns1, ns2, ns3 and ns4. ns1 and ns2 are connected to sw1, and
#  ns3 and ns4 are connected to sw2. ns1 needs to be in the same boradcast
#  domain as ns3, and ns2 needs to be in the same broadcast domain as ns4.
#  There is also a router called r1 connected to sw2. The goal is to be able
#  to ping from one namespace to the all the others.
#
# What to learn:
#  In this lab you will learn how to configure vlans on multiple switches.
#
# What to do:
#  First of all, you need to configure the second switch. The first switch
#  is already configured. You can check the config on sw1 by attaching to it
#  and using the `vlan/allprint` command.
#  You should see that sw1 has two vlans: vlan 10 and vlan 20. The first
#  port is untagged in vlan 10 (where ns1 is connected) and the second port is 
#  untagged in vlan 20 (where ns2 is connected). The 7th port is tagged in both 
#  vlans and is connected to sw2.
#
#  You should attach to sw2 and configure it in a similar way. The first port
#  should be untagged in vlan 10 (where ns3 is connected) and the second port
#  should be untagged in vlan 20 (where ns4 is connected). The 3rd port should
#  be tagged in both vlans and is connected to r1. The 7th port should be
#  tagged in both vlans and is connected to sw1.
#
#  Now you need to configure the ips on all the namespaces. Chose a network for
#  every each vlan. The configure the ips in the namespaces. If everything is
#  configured correctly you should be able to ping between ns1 and ns3, and 
#  between ns2 and ns4.
#
#  To be able to ping between namespaces in different vlans you need to con
#  the router r1. You need to create virtual interfaces in r1 for each vlan,
#  add an ip address to each interface and enable ip forwarding. Then you
#  need to add a default route in each namespace pointing to the router.
#  Then you should be able to ping between all the namespaces.
