# Description:
#  This example shows a simple example of static routing. In this case we have
#  two switch and a namespace connected to each of them. Then we have other two
#  namespaces. The last two namespaces are routers and are connected to one of
#  the switches and to each other. The end goal is to be able to ping between the
#  first two namespaces.
#
# What to learn:
#  In this lab you will learn how to configure a router with static routing.
#
# What to do:
#  Let's start naming things to avoid confusion. We will have two switches: sw1
#  and sw2. Then we have two PCs: ns1 and ns2. And to finish we have two routers:
#  r1 and r2.
#
#  The first switch is connected to ns1 and r1. The second switch is connected
#  to ns2 and r2. The two routers are connected to each other.
#
#  After configuring static routing on r1 and r2 you should be able to ping
#  between ns1 and ns2.
#
#  ns1 and ns2 are already configured with the ip address and the default gateway.
#  r1 and r2 are partially configured, you need to decide a new network for
#  the communication between the two routers and assign ip addresses to the
#  eth1 interfaces of r1 and r2.
#  For example you can chose 172.16.0.0/30 and assign the following ip addresses:
#  r1: 172.16.0.1/30
#  r2: 172.16.0.2/30
#
#  Then you need to enable ip forwarding on both routers. This can be done with the
#  following command:
#
#     /usr/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
#
#  After that you need to add static routes on both routers. On r1 you need to
#  add a route to the network of ns2 via r2, and on r2 you need to add a route
#  to the network of ns1 via r1. The commands for that is:
#
#     ip route add <destination network> via <next hop> dev <interface>
#
#  For example on r1 if you have chosed the previous network, the command is
#  the follwing:
#
#     ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 172.16.0.2 dev eth1
#
#  After configuring r1 and r2 you should be able to ping between ns1 and ns2.
