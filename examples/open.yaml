# This is not a lab. I will convert it as soon as possible.
# This example shows how to create an "open" connection. This is useful
# if you want to attach something manually to the topology without using
# imaginet. This is very useful for VMs as for imaginet is not simple to 
# start an manage them, so we offer a simple enpoint to connect them and 
# leave the rest to the user.
namespace:
  - name: ns1
    interfaces:
      - name: eth0

cable:
  - name: conn1
    endpoint_a:
      name: ns1
      port: eth0
    endpoint_b:
      name: open1
      open: true

# To use a open connection , after starting it, you need to run:
#
#       imaginet status -vvv
#
# You will see, under the connection endpoint, the full path for
# for the connection. The protocol is ptp. You will see something like:
#  Cables:
#  - conn1 active
#  	endpoint_a: PTP ./ns1/eth0 eth0
#  	endpoint_b: PTP /tmp/imnet/opn/open1 
#  	wirefilter: false
#  	config:
#
#  You can attach to endpoint_b using the following vde uri: ptp:///tmp/imnet/opn/open1
